DCS to TARGET converter.

Usage:
Put the dcs2target directory directly in the DCS directory.
You need cygwin or similar to compile it. Simple make will do.

Once you have the binary run:
./dcs2target_phase1.bat
./dcs2target_phase2.exe

The files will be in phase2 and phase2-raw directories. Macros from
phase2 require inclusion of lib-usb.tmh.

The lua part and format of the output file is based on the Sim2Target
